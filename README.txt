Description

This is my implementation of the hangman childrens game. I first came across this project from an old Stanford CS106A assignment(https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1124/handouts/200%20Assignment%204.pdf).
The basic idea is to make a hangman game. The user has 8 guesses to guess the correct word. If they don't guess the word in 8 guesses, then they lose the game.
The project is subdivided into three parts. I will be chronicling my progress and problems encountered at each step, and putting this all on GitHub.
