Project Name: Hangman

Description

This is my implementation of the hangman childrens game. I first came across this project from an old Stanford CS106A assignment(https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1124/handouts/200%20Assignment%204.pdf).
The basic idea is to make a hangman game. The user has 8 guesses to guess the correct word. If they don't guess the word in 8 guesses, then they lose the game.
The project is subdivided into three parts. For me, since I will be chronicling my progress and problems encountered at each step, and putting this all on GitHub, it will be four parts,
with the first part being creating and adding files from my local repository to my GitHub account.

Part One: Adding from local repository to GitHub

Things to Do
-Create a local repository to contain the project
-Initialize a local git repository
-Create a gitignore file
-Add relevant files to git repository
-Push the repo to the global repoisitory


Problems Encountered
-Didn't know how to create a .gitignore file locally in Windows
-Didn't know what files to add to the .gitignore files for an Eclipse project


Solution
-Use git bash and touch .gitignore to create the .gitignore file
-Helpful link for which files I should add to a .gitignore file for an Eclipse Project(https://www.jamescoyle.net/how-to/supporting-scripts/3027-gitignore-file-for-eclipse-projects)
